        <h3>Harvey Dale</h3>
        <p>
          Born and raised in Austin, Texas, at a young age Harvey Dale was gifted a guitar and a copy of The Clash's London Calling on vinyl. He never looked back.
        </p>
        <h3>Daniel Dale</h3>
        <p>
          Harvey's older brother, Daniel Dale has been shredding the drums since before Clinton entered office. A quiet individual and a party animal, Daniel, aka "Big Tex", embodies the Texan punk spirit.
        </p>
        <h3>Lewis Jones</h3>
        <p>
          Harvey and Daniel had a good thing going but knew it could reach another level, and that's when they ran into Lewis Jones strumming away at an Austin dive bar in the early oughts. The three hit it off and ever since Jones has been laying down bone-chilling baselines for the Cements.
